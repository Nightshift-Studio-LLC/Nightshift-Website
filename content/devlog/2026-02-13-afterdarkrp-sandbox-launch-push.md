## Current progress snapshot

AfterDarkRP has moved from placeholder planning to a real playable systems stack. The current build has:

- Job catalog flow across Civil, Government, and Criminal roles.
- Wallet and bank economy with persistence, payday timing, and payment history.
- ATM and crime terminal interactions for daily city loop gameplay.
- Police status pipeline: taze, stun, arrest, detain decision, and prison sentence timing.
- Justice spawn markers for courthouse and prison routing.

This gives us a working foundation for roleplay pressure, law enforcement response, and progression pacing.

## Launch timing and urgency

We are in a deliberate rush to launch before the April s&box release window. The goal is simple: arrive early with a stable core loop, then iterate live instead of waiting for a perfect first draft.

That means current work is focused on:

- Stabilizing the police/criminal interaction loop under real player stress.
- Finishing loadout wiring for utility weapons and job-based role identity.
- Cleaning onboarding/UI clarity so first-session retention is higher.

## What ships next

Before launch, we are targeting a minimum viable live package:

- Reliable economy cycle with controlled inflation pressure.
- Predictable justice flow from arrest to release.
- Clear job choices with meaningful risk/reward differences.
- Server-facing documentation and rules that match implemented behavior.

After that first release, updates will move quickly based on player behavior and telemetry.
