## Visual targets

We want the city to feel loud, neon, and packed with story beats. The art pass focuses on strong silhouettes, readable targets, and iconic color blocks.

## Mission flow

The first flow sketch uses a three-beat escalation: entry, complication, and a final surge where teams coordinate for a clean exit.

## What is next

We are pairing these sketches with prototype mission logic to test how chaos and clarity can coexist.
