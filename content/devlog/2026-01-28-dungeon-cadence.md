## Layout pacing

We are blocking rooms to keep squads moving while still creating pockets of safety. The pacing goal is to avoid long downtime while preserving short windows for regrouping.

## Loot and pressure

Loot tables now bias toward meaningful choices rather than pure upgrades. That means every chest has an opportunity cost that the team has to discuss quickly.

## Signals and roles

We are emphasizing role-based callouts so each player has a clear read on when to push, when to hold, and when to reset.
