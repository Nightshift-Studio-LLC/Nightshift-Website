## What we tested

We ran a series of small combat scenarios to test how quickly tension ramps and where players start to feel overwhelmed. The goal was to keep encounters fast without flattening the decision-making.

We compared three pacing models: short burst loops, slow pressure ramps, and a hybrid that spikes then settles. The hybrid model consistently delivered the strongest "one more try" feeling.

## What we learned

- Short bursts create excitement but can feel shallow if rewards land too early.
- Slow ramps build dread but risk fatigue if the peak takes too long.
- A spike-then-settle arc gives players a moment to breathe before the next escalation.

## Next steps

We are tuning enemy frequency and recovery windows to keep the loop readable while the stakes climb.
